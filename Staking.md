1~5 TAO

```
btcli stake add --amount <amount> --wallet.name redteam --wallet.hotkey redminer
```

Staking in Bittensor is the process of locking TAO tokens into the network to:
âœ… Activate your miner or validator on a subnet
ðŸ“ˆ Earn rewards (emissions) based on performance and stake weight
ðŸ“Š Influence your ranking and trust on the subnet


Think of staking as putting skin in the game. When you stake TAO:
- Youâ€™re signaling that youâ€™re serious about contributing.
- The more you stake (and the better your model performs), the more rewards you earn.
- Stake can be increased or unstaked later.

If you stake 5 TAO as a miner on RedTeam:
- Youâ€™re eligible to start mining (after registration).
- Your emission rewards scale with your performance + stake.
- You keep earning as long as you're online, responsive, and producing good outputs.

You can unstake your TAO after a cooldown (usually ~7 days).
```
btcli stake remove --amount 2.0 --wallet.name redteam --wallet.hotkey redminer

```

Why Does Bittensor Require Staking?
- Prevents spam and malicious nodes.
- Creates economic incentives for good behavior.
- Makes rewards proportional to contribution and trust.

> Traditional staking = buying a lottery ticket in a secure system
    Bittensor staking = investing in a worker (your AI miner) who gets paid based on performance


- Refine your model for better task performance.
- Analyze validator feedback.
- Improve response structure, speed, and correctness.
- Stake more TAO for higher influence (optional).
