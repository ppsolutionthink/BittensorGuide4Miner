## Introduction
You can easily create a Bittensor wallet without installing Bittensor using the Bittensor Wallet Chrome Extension. This extension allows you to manage your TAO directly through Google Chrome or other browsers that support Chrome Extensions. 
**However, if you want to participate in the network (e.g., mining, validating), you will need a "Local-Wallet".**
