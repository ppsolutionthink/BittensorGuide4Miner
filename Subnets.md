## Subnets

### Subnet Types
| Subnet Type	| Tasks | Requirements |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 💬 Language (e.g. Subnet 1) | LLM completions, Q&A | GPU, Python, Transformers |
| 🖼️ Vision/Image Gen | Image generation, captioning | GPU, Stable Diffusion, PyTorch |
| 📦 Storage | Decentralized file storage | CPU, storage disk space |
| 📊 Prediction | Forecasting markets, sports, etc. | Python, data science |
| 🌐 Data Gathering | Scraping, cleaning, summarizing | Scraper tools, bandwidth, CPU |
| 🎙️ Speech / TTS | Voice generation or processing | GPU, audio pipelines |
| 🧠 Pretraining | Training models from scratch | Powerful GPU cluster |


**Ask Yourself:**
- Do I have a GPU? (e.g., RTX 3060+ → good for LLM/image)
- Do I have disk space and bandwidth? (→ good for storage/data subnets)
- Do I know Python + AI/ML? (→ language, prediction)
- Can I write web scrapers / data pipelines? (→ data subnets)
- Do I want low barrier-to-entry? (→ storage, scraping)

**Best subnets to experiment on:**
| Subnet ID                      | Good For               | Why                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `11`, `14`, `21`, `261`, `333` | HelloWorld & testing   | Open, simple, low load |
| `1`, `5`, `13` (Mainnet)       | Real tasks (text/data) | Requires stake, GPU    |
